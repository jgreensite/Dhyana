# Dhyana

This project is an EDM continuous music generator inspired by the Anit EP by Autechre. It uses a combination of drum samples and a simple synth to create evolving rhythmic and melodic patterns.

The drum samples used in this project are from the SP1200 drum kit, which I found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Drumkits/comments/kt0nug/sp12_drumkit/

To run this project locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/Index.html
